    <h3>Hi, I am Vinh. A Catholic. A Programmer. A person in love.</h3>
    <p>
        I am just a humble, infamous programmer who is lucky enough to be loved by an awesome girl. I enjoy programming and love to build products. Since I discovered Linux, I've got hook up. PHP is my dream. During 2013, I start to get into Ruby world. I come for Linux, and I stay for Ruby now. I run a <a href="/shop">code component shop</a> beside creating my own products.
    </p>
    <p>
        I try to live a simply, own less thing, give more. I love Japanese art. Practice Kendo sometimes and watch anime with my lovely `spouse` every weekends. Not going to drop this habit. I trust in the Lord with all my heart.
