    <h3>I am Vinh. A Catholic. A Programmer.</h3>
    <p>
        I am just a humble, infamous programmer who is lucky enough to be loved by an awesome girl. I enjoy programming. I come for Linux and stay for Ruby. I try to live a simply, own less thing, give more. I love Japanese art. Practice Kendo sometimes and watch anime with my lovely `spouse` every weekends. Not going to drop this habit. I believe in God.
