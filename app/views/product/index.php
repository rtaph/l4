	<h3>We love open source&amp; free software </h3>
	<h4>
		Beside working on client projects, work on my day jons to make a living, I also 
    worked on personal project, or side project you could said.
    I try to open sourced them. 
    I do enjoy building them. And I hope you do when going aroudn my code,
    and try not to be mad at me when smell sth. Fork my project on github, and help me fix/refactor it if you have time.
    I research and dig to lastest 
		technology, then try to apply them for client's project if that will help to reduce the cost, make the work faster, more reliable.
    All is because I care about great web application with high performance, robust, and scalable. But notice that, I fail sometimes, so keep it in mind when checking out these things.
